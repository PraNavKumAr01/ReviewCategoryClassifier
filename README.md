# ReviewCategoryClassifier
Built a machine learning model which takes in a review and classifies into the specific category of that review.
Used SVM and gaussian naive bayes model and found svm gives more accuracy




Heatmap showing the accuracy of the SVM model.

As we can clearly see SVM had better recognition of the categories and made more correct predictions
